        <p>HI🖐 My name is Julia and I am what seem to be a totally mediocre 17 year-old Urkrainian girl.
            <br><br> I was born, raised and stil live in a beautiful <a href = 'lviv.html'>Lviv</a> region.
            <br><br> I am about two months short of graduating from my local high school (in Ukraine there're only 11 grades)
            and have every intention and abmbition of getting higher education in CS in Poland👩‍🎓
            <br><br> My probably most distinct trait is that I sort of am the truest representation of Jack of all trades.
            And despite my fairly young age I have a tremendous amount of hobbies and things that I am interested in. What some of those might be?
            <br><br>
            Well... First and foremost, I am absolutely fascinated by all things logic ,I guess I'm just one of those folks who have
            analytical brain or whatever. But in any case, I totally love math and playing chess (mostly for it's
            amazing complexity and, wierdly, simplicity), and I guess that is also the reason why I am drawn to Computer Science as well👩‍💻
            <br><br> Another thing I'm really passionate about is music, Rock in particular. I've been playing guitar (both acoustic and electric)
            for quite a while now and I dare say I'm pretty good at it🎸
            <br><br> Also, I really love baking stuff. I have a severe sweet tooth and that is my way of exploring how all the amazing sweets of
            the world are made🧁
            <br><br>Another thing that I really like doing is painting abstract things, especially with acrylics on big canvases. Just to be clear,
            I don't consider myself to be particularly creative, and painting for me is more of a terapeutic exercise that gives me time and space
            to contemplate whatever happens to be on my mind, rather that being a way to express myself 🎨
            <br><br>Last hobby I'll tell you about (even though there are many more) is what I call consumption of stories. By that I essentially
            mean reading a lot of books and watching movies. I don't just consume that content blindly though, after reading a good book ar watching
            a good movie I try to reflect on whatever the author was trying to say and ideally write down my own thoughts on the matter.🎭
            <br><br> Speaking of consuming content, if you ask me, the best way to get to know a person is to get to know some of the things
            a given person likes. For that reason I made a list of all <a href = 'favorites.html'>my favorite books, movies, and songs</a> so that you can get to know me a litte better
            and mabye get some recomendations as well:)
        </p>
